# TypeScript is a programming language that adds types to JavaScript. It allows us to write JavaScript with a set of tools called a type system that can spot potential bugs in, clarify the structure of, and help refactor our code.

TypeScript is a syntactic superset of JavaScript which adds static typing.

We write TypeScript code in files with the extension .ts.
Next, we run our code through the TypeScript transpiler. The transpiler will check that the code adheres to TypeScript’s standards, and it will display errors when it does not.

If the TypeScript code can be converted into working JavaScript, the transpiler will output a JavaScript version of the file (.js).

TypeScript code is a superset of JavaScript code—it has all the features of traditional JavaScript but adds some new features.

The first things we’ll discover with TypeScript is that when we declare a variable with an initial value, the variable can never be reassigned a value of a different data type.
